This filament storage is designed to keep 3D printer filament dry and protected from moisture.
The project is modified from a 15L Minerale water gallon, repurposed into a practical, low-cost, and easy-to-build filament storage solution.

The design allows the filament to be used directly from inside the storage, with optional additions such as silica gel or a hygrometer for humidity monitoring.
